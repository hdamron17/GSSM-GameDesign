Hunter Damron's Gremm Tunnel
============================

#TODO name is highly subject to change

Overview
--------

Gremm Tunnel is a single player game in which the player attempts to escape the underwater marsh as a gremlin. Because of the dampness, the gremlins are subject to multiplying. There is no timer, but if you take too long, the world will be covered in Gremlins.

Usage
-----

To play Gremm Tunnel, run ```python gremm_tunnel.py``` ensuring that you have the correct dependencies installed in your python path. Dependencies can be installed with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
