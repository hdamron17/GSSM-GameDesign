Hunter Damron's Gremm Tunnel
============================

After three years of vicious war against the humans, the gremlins were finally pushed back into the deepest caverns of Eastern Slovakia. Most died of starvation and some of insane fits of rage. But one gremlin survived, kept alive only by the thought of revenge on the human race. He has found water and may finally be able to escape. With your help, he may be able to find light among the darkness.

Use the forward key to move in your current direction and the left and right keys to turn. Each room leads to another, but one door leads out of the cave. But there's a twist - by moving through mirrors, gremlins divide. With each key, all gremlin doplegaengers move simultaneously. It may be useful for multitasking, but beware, when gremlins collide, they turn to salt and block the way. Make sure not to block the path because life is evil and may not tell you when you've lost the game. Good luck.
